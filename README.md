# Apache-Spark-SQL-for-Data-Analysts
Apache Spark is one of the most widely used technologies in big data analytics. 
This course taught me how to leverage existing SQL skills to start working with Spark immediately. 
I also learned how to work with Delta Lake, a highly performant, open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. 
Now I can use Spark SQL and Delta Lake to ingest, transform, and query data to extract valuable insights that can be shared with my team.
